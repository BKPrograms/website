        The Computer Science Student Community (CSSC) is an open space for Computer Science students to come in and ask questions about their university and post-university career. We act as liaisons to the Computer Science faculty to ensure that all students can seek appropriate support and guidance. The CSSC seeks to support students through community initiatives built upon inclusivity and empowerment.
