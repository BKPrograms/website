### What is CSC209?
CSC236 is a different than the other first and second year computer science courses offer here at UTM. CSC236 is a course that focuses on proving the correctness and the runtime of both iterative and recursive algorithms.

After this course, students will have mastered the different types of induction and using them to prove both the correctness and the runtime of algorithms.
### Topics in CSC236:
- Induction including Complete and Structural Induction
- Runtime analysis
- Recursion
- Mastery Theorem
- Program Correctness 
- Regular Languages
- Deterministic finite automaton
- Nondeterministic finite automaton
