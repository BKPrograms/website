# Contributing Resources

Our resources are highly dependent on contributors. These pages are created by
the students to make their computer science journey a little bit easier. These
resources can help you learn a new technology and gain better marks in courses
through the resources provided in the course resources.

These pages are never complete and you are encouraged to contribute to help
other students.

To begin adding resources, please look at the following guidelines for guidance.

## Pre-requisites

### Markdown

Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format
virtually any document.

In nuxt we use Markdown to create a resource.

## Starting/Appending resources

To create or extend a resource we have provided:

1. A template which makes it easier to get started (you don't have to follow it
   explicitly).
2. We have also provided a list of Do's and Don'ts

### Course Resource

#### Template

- Prereq
- Course Website
- What is it about?
- Topics Covered
- Resources
- Next Steps

#### Donâ€™t

- Cannot put a lab/prep on the website
- Cannot put any course content/ course resources on the website (including
  lecture recordings, lecture notes, slides, etc)

#### Dos

- Use components like
  ([2x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x2.vue),
  [3x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x3.vue))
  for better designs.
- Try to follow the template for consistency across the website.

### Technology Resource

#### Template

- What is the resource?
- Why do we use this technology/ how is it useful?
- Resources for learning
- Cheat Sheets
- VS code extensions
- Further Steps

#### Dos

- Try to give free resources (such as youtube videos, freecodecamp links, etc.)
- Try to follow the template for consistency across the website.
- Use components like
  ([2x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x2.vue),
  [3x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x3.vue))
  for better designs.

### Unit Testing Guide

<!-- Chris please complete this as I am not sure how unit testing works in Vue -->

#### Template

- Why Unit test?
- How does unit testing on the web work compared to backend unit testing?
- Resources for unit testing (Link to Vue mastery)
- Perhaps give a small outline/sample of a Unit test for a small component
