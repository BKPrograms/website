# Resource Contribution

## Template

**Note:** This template is subject to change and doesn't need to be strictly
followed.

The following is a generic template that our resources should follow more or
less to ensure layout consistency:

- What is the resource?
- What should you choose/use such resource?
- How to get started
  - Use our 1x2 grid components
  - Try to provide as many free and valuable resources as possible
- Cheat Sheets
- VSCode Extensions (If applicable)
- Next Steps

## Example

The following is a sample of the Docker resource page layout:

- What is Docker?
- What are Containers?
- Why Docker?
- How do I get started?
  - Docker101 for developers!
- Cheat Sheets
