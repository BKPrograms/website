# Contributing Resources

Our resources are highly dependent on our contributors. These pages were created
by students to make their computer science journey a little bit easier.

Our resource pages are constantly being developed/improved upon and we highly
encourage you to contribute to improve the quality of our resources!

To begin adding resources, take a look at the following guidelines.

## Prerequisites

### Markdown

Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use markup language that you can use to format
virtually any document/.

In Nuxt, we use Markdown to create our resources!

## Starting/Appending resources

To create or extend a resource, we have provided:

1. A template which makes it easier to get started (you don't have to follow it
   strictly).
2. A list of Do's and Don'ts

**Note:** The following is a generic template that our resources should follow
more or less to ensure the page layout consistency.

### Course Resource

#### Template

- Prerequisites
- Course Website
- What is it about?
- Topics Covered
- Resources
- Next Steps

#### Donâ€™t

- You can't put any labs on the website
- You can't put any course content/course resources on the website (including
  lecture recordings, lecture notes, slides, etc.)

#### Dos

- Use components like
  ([2x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x2.vue),
  [3x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x3.vue))
  for better designs.
- Try to follow our templates to maintain page layout consistency across the
  website.

### Technology Resource

#### Template

- What is the resource?
- Why do we use this technology/ how is it useful?
- Resources for learning
- Cheat Sheets
- VS code extensions
- Further Steps

#### Dos

- Try to give free resources (such as youtube videos, freecodecamp links, etc.)
- Try to follow the template for consistency across the website.
- Use components like
  ([2x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x2.vue),
  [3x1](https://github.com/utm-cssc/website/blob/master/components/global/Grid1x3.vue))
  for better designs.
